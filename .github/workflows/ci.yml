  # Note: Deployment is simulated because:
  # 1. This is a local-only assessment (no public Kubernetes cluster)
  # 2. GitHub Actions cannot access local k3d clusters
  # 3. Pushing to public registries (GHCR/DockerHub) requires credentials
  # 4. ArgoCD GitOps handles actual deployment in the local k3d cluster
  #
  # In production, this job would:
  # - Push image to container registry (GHCR/ECR/DockerHub)
  # - Update k8s/deployment.yaml with new image tag
  # - Commit change to trigger ArgoCD auto-sync
